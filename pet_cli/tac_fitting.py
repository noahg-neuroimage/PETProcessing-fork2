"""
This module provides functionalities for fitting Tissue Compartment Models (TCM) to Time Activity Curves (TAC)
using various methods.

It includes classes that handle different parts of the TAC fitting process:
    - :class:`TACFitter`: The primary class for fitting TCMs to TACs. It provides utility methods to prepare data,
      set up fitting parameters, and perform the curve fitting. This class allows fitting based on various TCM functions
      such as one-tissue compartment model (1TCM), 2TCM, and others.
    - :class:`TACFitterWithoutBloodVolume`: A subclass of TACFitter designed for scenarios when there is no signal
      contribution from blood volume in the TAC. It utilises the functionalities of :class:`TACFitter` and modifies
      certain methods to exclude the blood volume parameter.

Functions and methods in this module use :mod:`numpy` and :mod:`scipy` packages for data manipulation and optimization
of the fitting process.

Please refer to the documentation of each class for more detailed information.

class TACFitter(object):
    r"""
    A class used for fitting Tissue Compartment Models(TCM) to Time Activity Curves (TAC).

    It facilitates and simplifies the curve fitting process of TCM functions to TAC data. The class
    takes in raw TAC data for the plasma and tissue as input, and provides numerous utility methods
    to prepare data, set up fitting parameters, and perform the curve fitting. The resample method ensures
    data is appropriate for curve fitting by interpolating the TAC data over a regular time grid, and includes a
    time=0 data-point to the TACs if necessary.

    The class provides multiple options for setting up weights for the curve fitting residuals and for providing
    initial guesses and setting up bounds for the fitting parameters of the TCM function.

    Allows fitting on the basis of various TCM functions like one-tissue compartment model (1TCM), 2TCM, and others.

    Attributes:
        resample_times (np.ndarray): Times at which TACs are resampled.
        resampled_t_tac (np.ndarray): Tissue TAC values resampled at these times.
        p_tac_vals (np.ndarray): Plasma TAC values used for feeding to TCM function.
        raw_t_tac (np.ndarray): Raw TAC times for tissue, fed at initialization.
        weights (np.ndarray): Weights for handling residuals during the optimization process.
        tgt_tac_vals (np.ndarray): Tissue TAC values to fit TCM model.
        fit_param_number (int): Number of fitting parameters in the TCM function.
        initial_guesses (np.ndarray): Initial guesses for all the parameters for curve fitting.
        bounds_hi (np.ndarray): Upper bounds for all the parameters for curve fitting.
        fit_results (np.optimize.OptimizeResult): The results of the fit, including optimized parameters and covariance
            matrix.
        fit_param_names (List[str]): Names of fitting parameters in the TCM function.
        raw_p_tac (np.ndarray): Raw TAC times for plasma, fed at initialization.
        resampled_p_tac (np.ndarray): Plasma TAC values resampled on these times.
        sanitized_t_tac (np.ndarray): Sanitized version of tissue TAC times.
        bounds_lo (np.ndarray): Lower bounds for all the parameters for curve fitting.
        bounds (np.ndarray): Bounds for each parameter for curve fitting.
        max_func_evals (int): Maximum number of function evaluations (iterations) for the optimization process.
        tcm_func (Callable): The tissue compartment model (TCM) function to fit.

    Example:
        In the following quick example, ``tTAC`` represents a tissue TAC (``[times, values]``) and ``pTAC`` represents the
        input function (``[times, values]``). Furthermore, we want to fit the provided ``tTAC`` with a 2TCM.

        Resample pTAC and tTAC evenly with respect to time, and at the same times.

        The method takes a threshold in minutes and a resample number as inputs. It starts by sanitizing
        the pTAC and tTAC (prepending a :math:`f(t=0)=0` point to data if necessary). A regularly sampled time is
        then generated using the start, end, and number of samples dictated by resample_num. Following this,
        an interpolation object is created using the :class:`pet_cli.blood_input.BloodInputFunction` class for the pTAC.
        This allows both interpolation and extrapolation for times beyond the pTAC onto the new tTAC times.

        Finally, the method resamples the sanitized tTAC and pTAC across these new evenly distributed
        times to ensure that they are regularly spaced over time. These resampled values are stored for
        future computations. The :math:`\Delta t` for the regularly sampled times is also stored.

            resample_num (int): Number of samples to generate when resampling the tTAC. This will be the total
