"""
The 'image_operations_4d' module provides several functions used to do preprocessing
on 4D PET imaging series. These functions typically take one or more paths to imaging
data in NIfTI format, and save modified data to a NIfTI file, and may return the
modified imaging array as output.

Class :class:`ImageOps4D` is also included in this module, and provides specific
implementations of the functions presented herein.

def weighted_series_sum(input_image_4d_path: str, out_image_path: str, half_life: float, verbose: bool) -> np.ndarray:
    r"""
    Sum a 4D image series weighted based on time and re-corrected for decay correction.

    First, a scaled image is produced by multiplying each frame by its length in seconds,
    and dividing by the decay correction applied:

    .. math::
    
        f_i'=f_i\times \frac{t_i}{d_i}

    Where :math:`f_i,t_i,d_i` are the i-th frame, frame duration, and decay correction factor of
    the PET series. This scaled image is summed over the time axis. Then, to get the output, we
    multiply by a factor called `total decay` and divide by the full length of the image:

    .. math::

        d_{S} = \frac{\lambda*t_{S}}{(1-\exp(-\lambda*t_{S}))(\exp(\lambda*t_{0}))}

    .. math::
    
        S(f) = \sum(f_i') * d_{S} / t_{S}

    where :math:`\lambda=\log(2)/T_{1/2}` is the decay constant of the radio isotope,
    :math:`t_0` is the start time of the first frame in the PET series, the subscript :math:`S`
    indicates the total quantity computed over all frames, and :math:`S(f)` is the final weighted
    sum image.

    
    Args:

            PET image on which the weighted sum is calculated. Assume a metadata
