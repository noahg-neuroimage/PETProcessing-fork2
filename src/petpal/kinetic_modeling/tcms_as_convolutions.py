"""
This module contains a collection of functions to compute Time-Activity Curves (TACs) for common Tissue Compartment
Models (TCMs). These models are commonly used for kinetic analysis of PET TACs.

Note:
    All response functions in this module are decorated with :func:`numba.jit`. It compiles the function to
    machine code at runtime (Just-In-Time compilation), which usually provides a significant speed-up.

Requires:
    The module relies on the :doc:`numpy <numpy:index>` and :doc:`numba <numba:index>` modules.

TODO:
    Add the derivations of the solutions to the Tissue Compartment Models in the module docstring.
